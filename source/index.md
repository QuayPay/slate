# Introduction

Welcome to the QuayPay API Documentation!

Here we aim to document the use of our API endpoints for working with stored cards, charges, loyalty points and user authentication.

We currently offer a JavaScript client library to accompany our raw HTTP API and plan to release support for other languages shortly.

## Getting Started

These are the basic steps for setting up access and use of the QuayPay payments API on your merchant website:

1. <a href="#">Register for an Access</a> to receive your application ID and merchant account details
1. <a href="#modifying-an-application">Modify your Application</a> with your authentication settings and loyalty points configuration
1. <a href="#authentication">Set up Authentication</a> so your users can register and login to QuayPay on your site
1. Enjoy full use of QuayPay's <a href="#creating-a-card">Credit Card Storage</a>, <a href="#points">Loyalty Points</a> and other features
