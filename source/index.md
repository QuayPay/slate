# Introduction

Welcome to the QuayPay API Documentation! Here we aim to document the use of our API endpoints for working with stored cards, charges, loyalty points and user authentication.

We currently offer a JavaScript client library to accompany our raw HTTP API and plan to release support for other languages shortly.
